ðŸ‘‹Hi there ðŸ‘‹ as I sat in my auto one day ....
I had lost my way .... I would soon recall Dijkstra's Algorithm and many more. 
I am here to collaborate ,  learn , build an application. An application to assist an aging population. This application will help lead change 
the way we view aging , help with healthy lifestyle habits, the loneliness , loss of independence  as 
guiding that segment back to learning. An application that would taylor their needs using algorithms
to guide them through their favorite stores. No more getting loss in the aisles. 
Whats your reason? I had forgotten my reason , Until that day on a parking lot ... 
picked up my phone ,  saw Google app on my phone . Yes indeed algorithms utilized everyday.
As they guided me safely to my tutoring class .I am still in the learning phase.
