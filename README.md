ðŸ‘‹Hi there ðŸ‘‹ as I sat in my auto one day ....
I had lost my way .... I would soon recall Dijkstra's Algorithm and many more. 
I am here to collaborate ,  learn , build an application. An application to assist a population. This application will help lead change 
preventing  data manipulation , changing  of content in transcripts As my memory is returning .
guiding that segment back to learning. An application would protect individuals from being taken advantage in United States Courts . 
What's your reason? I had forgotten my reason , Until that day on a parking lot ... 
picked up my phone ,  saw Google app on my phone . Yes indeed algorithms utilized everyday
